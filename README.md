# 🚀 Customer Churn Analysis SQL Project 🚀
## 🔍 What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn happens when customers stop using a company’s services and move to competitors. In the banking world, this means losing customers to other banks. High churn rates can harm a bank’s reputation and point to deeper issues whether it’s poor customer experience, inefficient processes, or lack of competitive products.

## 💼 Why It Matters:
For any business, two key objectives are essential for growth:
- Acquiring new customers
- Retaining existing ones

## 🔎 Project Approach:
To understand and address customer churn, data analysis plays a crucial role. By analyzing historical data, we can uncover hidden insights that help retain customers and improve business strategies. For this project, I used SQL to conduct a detailed churn analysis, identifying key factors that influence customer behavior.

## 📊 Tools Used:
- SQL (for analysis)

## Data Description:
The dataset entails customer information, including credit scores, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and estimated salary. It also includes Boolean fields, represented by 0 or 1, which categorize data such as country, gender, credit card ownership, active membership status, and whether the customer has churned. The last column, “exited,” indicates the customer’s current status, with a value of 1 signifying that the customer has left.
