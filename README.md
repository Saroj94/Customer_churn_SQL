🔍 What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn happens when customers stop using a company’s services and move to competitors. In the banking world, this means losing customers to other banks. High churn rates can harm a bank’s reputation and point to deeper issues whether it’s poor customer experience, inefficient processes, or lack of competitive products.
💼 Why It Matters:
For any business, two key objectives are essential for growth:
	1.	Acquiring new customers
	2.	Retaining existing ones

🔎 Project Approach:
To understand and address customer churn, data analysis plays a crucial role. By analyzing historical data, we can uncover hidden insights that help retain customers and improve business strategies. For this project, I used SQL to conduct a detailed churn analysis, identifying key factors that influence customer behavior.

📊 Tools Used:
	•	SQL (for analysis)
